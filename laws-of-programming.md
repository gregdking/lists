# Laws of Programming

1. Any function should describe a workflow or a step in a workflow, never both.
2. Optimizing code for performance or reusability should not be done until needed, unless the change is simple and just as readable. 
  Then you should just learn to do that way the first time.
3. Never reference an external resource from a constructor unless that resource is passed in.
4. You are either writing an API or consuming one. Decide which and own it.
  1. Corollary - All your code can be considered an API, own it.
